### PURPOSE AND SCOPE
A paragraph describing the purpose of the system and the environment in which it will be used. Describe the likely users of the system, and list the stakeholders in the project (if it is being developed for an organization or business). Indicate whether the goal of the project is to deliver a fully functional application for an organization or other end-users, or to construct a prototype implementation for experimental purposes.

### FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION 
This section describes the primary functionality or services to be provided by the system. Include one or more paragraphs describing the tasks to be performed, major types of input and output, and types of interfaces to be supported (may include both user interfaces and interfaces with other systems or databases).
The goal of this section is that all involved people (users, designers, and any stakeholders) can read and understand the essential functions that the system is intended to provide. 

### CONSTRAINTS 
Any known constraints that will affect the development of the system should be described in this section. Typical categories include: 
- available resources (hardware, software, expertise)
- external environment: 
type of potential users, and any factors that may impact the readiness of the organization to adapt to the proposed type of technology (e.g., economic or time constraints)
-required interfaces:
Describe any existing hardware/software systems with which your system must interact and the type of user interfaces that are required (if known).
-	cost limits:
Estimate the cost of any hardware or software components that are not freely available.
-	schedule requirements:
Describe when the system should be available. Consider whether the project requires any components to be available on a schedule that is not determined by the regular course schedule.

Constraints should be identified as soon as possible because the time and resources available to the project are limited. The goals and constraints will be reviewed to assure that the scope of the project is appropriate for the available time and resources.
